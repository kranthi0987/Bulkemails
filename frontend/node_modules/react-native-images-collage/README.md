To keep up to date with the latest fixes. See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/lukebrandonfarrell/react-native-images-collage/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Install

Install via npm:
```sh
 npm install react-native-images-collage --save
```

## Usage

To use in React Native. Import:
```js
 import { DynamicCollage, StaticCollage } from 'react-native-images-collage';
```

### Dynamic Collage

A dynamic collage includes panning, scaling and image arrangement.

```js
  <DynamicCollage
    width={400}
    height={400}
    images={ photos }
    matrix={ [ 1, 1, 1, 1 ] } />
```

### Static Collage

A static collage does not include any panning, scaling or arrangement logic. Use this if you want to render multiple non-interactive collages. Same props as the dynamic collage.

```js
  <StaticCollage
    width={400}
    height={400}
    images={ photos }
    matrix={ [ 1, 1, 1, 1 ] } />
```

### Layouts

Instead of building your own matrix of collage layouts. There is a JSON file you can import which includes multiple layouts. Up to 6 images.
```js
 import { LayoutData } from 'react-native-images-collage';
```

You can then access a layout like so:
```js
 matrix={ LayoutData[NumberOfImages][i].matrix }
 direction={ LayoutData[NumberOfImages][i].direction }
```

The number in the first bracket will be the configuration you want to access. E.g. configuration for 5 images. The second number is the specific layout you want to access e.g. [2, 2, 1]. You will have to inspect the JSON file to find this out.

### Notes

- If you want to capture the collage as a single image. Take a look at [react-native-view-shot](https://github.com/gre/react-native-view-shot).
- The number of images has to be equal to the sum of the matrix. e.g. Matrix is [ 1, 2, 1 ] ( 1 + 2 + 1 = 4), there has to be 4 images.
- The collage scaling will not work when in a react-native [<Modal />](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/modal) component. [Multiple touches are not registered](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/8094).

| width               | float         | No        |         | Width of component. REQUIRED. Used to calculate image boundaries for switching.         |
| height              | float         | No        |         | Height of component. REQUIRED. Used to calculate image boundaries for switching.        |
| images              | array         | No        |         | Images for the collage.                                                                 |
| matrix              | array         | No        |         | An array [ 1, 1, 1 ] equal to the number of images. Used to define the layout.          |
| direction           | string        | Yes       | row     | Direction of the collage: 'row' or 'column'.                                            |
| panningLeftPadding  | number        | Yes       | 15      | Distance image can go beyond the left edge before it is restricted.                     |
| panningRightPadding | number        | Yes       | 15      | Distance image can go beyond the right edge before it is restricted.                    |
| panningTopPadding   | number        | Yes       | 15      | Distance image can go beyond the top edge before it is restricted.                      |
| panningBottomPadding| number        | Yes       | 15      | Distance image can go beyond the bottom edge before it is restricted.                   |
| scaleAmplifier      | number        | Yes       | 1.0     | Amplifier applied to scaling. Increase this for faster scaling of images.               |
| retainScaleOnSwap   | boolean       | Yes       | true    | Keep the scale (width/height) of image when it is swapped.                              |
| longPressDelay      | number        | Yes       | 500     | Delay before long press is activated.                                                   |
